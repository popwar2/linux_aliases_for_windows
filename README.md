LINUX COMMANDS FOR WINDOWS!

Do you loathe having to learn windows commnads when you're life has already been enlightened by linux? Are you constantly looking up the crappy and clearly inferior windows equivalent of a Linux Master Race (TM) command? Does you're employer require you to actually use a windows machine (ew gross you should find a real job)? Never fear, I have the half backed homebrewed solution for you! Yes dear reader, for the low low equivalent price of belly button lint you can have Linux Master Race (TM) commands on your smelly Windows Machine. No more looking up pwd or forgetting that ls isn't a command on windows. Just do the following 

1) Download these puppies 
2) Stuff them in your C:\windows dir., or run the super not shady copy script included.
3) Enjoy being part of the Glorious Linux Master Race(TM)

*** FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY. ****
4) Install Ubuntu
5) Continue waiting for your wifi-card's linux drivers to be released
6) Buy a 10,000ft spool of Cat 5 cable
